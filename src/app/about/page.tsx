        <br />
        <br />
        Hi, I&apos;m Osman! Hailing from the suburban sprawl of Mississauga, I
        now roam the streets of Toronto looking for food and matcha to add to my
        Beli. While I look for full-time employment I occasionally work on
        data-driven intelligence tools for {""}

        .
        <br />
        <br />
        I&apos;m an industrial engineer and software developer who is a serial
        hobby hopper with terminal FOMO.
        <br />
        <br />
        I love dabbling in as many disciplines as possible, learning by
        experimenting, and building by breaking. I&apos;m also happy to chat or
        collaborate! Don&apos;t hesitate to reach out Àô·µïÀô
